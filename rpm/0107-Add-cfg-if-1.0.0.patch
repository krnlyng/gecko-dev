+# cfg-if
+
+[Documentation](https://docs.rs/cfg-if)
+
+A macro to ergonomically define an item depending on a large number of #[cfg]
+parameters. Structured like an if-else chain, the first matching branch is the
+item that gets emitted.
+
+```toml
+[dependencies]
+cfg-if = "0.1"
+```
+
+## Example
+
+```rust
+cfg_if::cfg_if! {
+    if #[cfg(unix)] {
+        fn foo() { /* unix specific functionality */ }
+    } else if #[cfg(target_pointer_width = "32")] {
+        fn foo() { /* non-unix, 32-bit functionality */ }
+    } else {
+        fn foo() { /* fallback implementation */ }
+    }
+}
+
+fn main() {
+    foo();
+}

+//! A macro for defining `#[cfg]` if-else statements.
+//!
+//! The macro provided by this crate, `cfg_if`, is similar to the `if/elif` C
+//! preprocessor macro by allowing definition of a cascade of `#[cfg]` cases,
+//! emitting the implementation which matches first.
+//!
+//! This allows you to conveniently provide a long list `#[cfg]`'d blocks of code
+//! without having to rewrite each clause multiple times.
+//!
+//! # Example
+//!
+//! ```
+//! cfg_if::cfg_if! {
+//!     if #[cfg(unix)] {
+//!         fn foo() { /* unix specific functionality */ }
+//!     } else if #[cfg(target_pointer_width = "32")] {
+//!         fn foo() { /* non-unix, 32-bit functionality */ }
+//!     } else {
+//!         fn foo() { /* fallback implementation */ }
+//!     }
+//! }
+//!
